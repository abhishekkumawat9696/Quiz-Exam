**Features:**
- User Roles:
Admin:Manage user accounts (students and instructors)Create and manage exam categoriesMonitor ongoing exams and view overall statisticsInstructor:Create and manage exams and question banksSchedule exams and assign them to specific student groupsEvaluate descriptive answers and publish resultsStudent:Register and log in to the portalView available exams and attempt themView their exam results and performance analysisFunctionality:
#Authentication and Authorization:
User registration and login using JWT for secure accessRole-based access control ensuring appropriate permissionsExam Management:Create exams with different question types (multiple-choice, descriptive, true/false)Define exam duration, start time, and end timeRandomize question order for each studentQuestion Bank:Create, update, and delete questionsCategorize questions by subject, difficulty level, etc.Exam Attempt:Students can attempt exams within the scheduled time frameAuto-save answers to prevent data lossEvaluation and Results:Auto-evaluation for objective type questionsManual evaluation for descriptive questionsGenerate detailed result reports with performance analyticsDashboard:Real-time statistics and analytics for admins and instructorsPersonal performance dashboard for studentsTech Stack:Backend:JavaSpring Boot:Spring Data JPA for database interactionsSpring Security for authentication and authorizationSpring MVC for RESTful API developmentHibernate for ORMFrontend:Angular:Angular CLI for project scaffoldingAngular Router for navigationAngular Forms for handling user inputHTTPClient for making API callsAngular Material for UI componentsDatabase:MySQL/PostgreSQL:Relational database for storing user data, exam data, and resultsTools and Environment:Maven/Gradle for build automationGit for version controlPostman for API testingDocker for containerization (optional)Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline (optional)Implementation Steps:Project Setup:Initialize the Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.Set up Angular application using Angular CLI.Backend Development:Configure database and JPA entities.Implement RESTful APIs for user management, exam management, question management, and result processing.Implement security using Spring Security and JWT.Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.Frontend Development:Create Angular services to interact with backend APIs.Develop components for login, registration, exam listing, exam taking, and result viewing.Implement form validation and error handling.Use Angular Material to design a responsive and user-friendly interface.Integration:Integrate frontend and backend using HTTPClient in Angular.Ensure seamless data flow and synchronization between frontend and backend.Testing and Deployment:Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) or on-premises server.
